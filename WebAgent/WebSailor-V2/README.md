## ðŸ¥‡ Introduction

- **WebSailor-V2** is the second version of [**WebSailor**](https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/DeepResearch/tree/main/WebAgent/WebSailor)

- **WebSailor-V2**, a complete post-training pipeline encompassing data construction, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our methodology features two key innovations: (1) On the data front, we developed SailorFog-QA-2, a novel dataset built from a densely interconnected knowledge graph that introduces a wide variety of uncertainties beyond simple obfuscation, fostering more sophisticated reasoning. (2) For training, we engineered a dual-environment RL framework, combining a high-fidelity simulator for rapid, low-cost algorithmic iteration with a robust, managed real-world environment for stable final policy training, all integrated within a symbiotic data-policy feedback loop. 

## ðŸš€ Performance Highlights

Trained on the Qwen3-30B-A3B model, WebSailor-V2 achieves state-of-the-art results, scoring 35.3 on BrowseComp-EN, 44.1 on BrowseComp-ZH, and 30.6 on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). Notably, our 30B-A3B MOE agent significantly outperforms all existing open-source agents and surpasses even the 671B DeepSeek-V3.1, demonstrating performance competitive with leading proprietary systems.
