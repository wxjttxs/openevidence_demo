Towards General Agentic Intelligence via Environment Scaling</h1>


## ðŸŒŸOverview

In this work, we scale up environments as a step towards advancing general agentic intelligence. This gives rise to two central challenges: (i) how to scale environments in a principled manner, and (ii) how to effectively train agentic capabilities from experiences derived through inter-actions with these environments. To address these, we design a scalable framework that automatically constructs heterogeneous environments that are fully simulated, systematically broadening the space of function-calling scenarios. We further adapt a two-phase agent fine-tuning strategy: first endowing agentswith fundamental agentic capabilities, then specializing them for domain-specific contexts. Extensive experiments on agentic benchmarks, Ï„-bench, Ï„2-Bench, and ACEBench, demonstrate that our trained model, AgentScaler, significantly enhances the modelsâ€™ function-calling capability.

## ðŸ”§Framework
We introduce a principled pipeline that comprises two central stages: (i) fully simulated
environment construction and scaling, which establishes and expands diverse agentic scenarios, and (ii)
agent experience learning, which exploits these environments to foster generalizable intelligence.
